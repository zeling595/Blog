### All Objectives that I have attempted

Over the weekend, I have attempted to create the minimal viable product as well as a few optional tasks, which are listed below.

* Display user information and user's blog posts
* Use React in my implementation
* Use Material UI library to asist in achieving the UI and mobile responsiveness
* Make API request based on user ID
* Add a visual loader to show progress when the page is loading
* Add a "Change User" button to allow switching user
* Host the website using netlify
